How to get your sunrise connection working via a media-converter rather than being forced to
use your sunrise internet box.


1. Basic connectivity

I use a TP-Link MC220L to convert between fiber and Cat6 ethernet.

You will need to ask on VLAN10 for an IP address, supplying a Sunrise DHCP option:

vconfig eth0 10
dhcpcd -4 -t 40 -v 60,dslforum.org,Fast5360-sunrise -G eth0.10


2. VoIP

I couldn't find a way to get the VoIP account password from sunrise, so I just
stuck the internet box on VLAN10 off eth1 and called it good. Here's my dhcpd.conf
for it. You'll have to sniff the real transaction to get the appropriate vendor
string values, but it turns out that you can use your media converter to do that:

* Bridge eth0 and eth1 on your linux box:
  brctl addbr br0
  brctl addif br0 eth0
  brctl addif br0 eth1

Stick your sunrise WAN port into eth1, plug your media converter into eth0, and
tcpdump the traffic as your sunrise box boots up:
  # tcpdump -s0 -X -ni br0 port 67 or port 68

You'll have to translate the vendor string into hex - I'll leave that as an exercise
for the reader! The NNN:NNN at least for me were all numbers.

host sunrise-voip { 
        hardware ethernet 00:11:22:33:44:55;
        fixed-address sunrise-voip.net.your-domain.com;
        option domain-name-servers 212.98.37.128, 194.230.55.99;
        #option vendor-string "\x01)http://acs.sunrise.ch:7547/ACS-server/ACS\x02\xNNNNNNNN:NNNNNNNNNN"
        option vendor-string 01:29:68:74:74:70:3a:2f:2f:61:63:73:2e:73:75:6e:72:69:73:65:2e:63:68:3a:37:35:34:37:2f:41:43:53:2d:73:65:72:76:65:72:2f:41:43:53:02:11:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;
}


3. Sunrise TV

Actually you'll have to do the same tcpdump trick as before, to find out what
sunrise's DHCP server is going to give your TV box. Again, here's my dhcpd.conf
entry.

host sunrise-iptv {
        hardware ethernet 00:11:22:aa:bb:cc;
        fixed-address sunrise-iptv.net.your-domain.com;
        option domain-name-servers 212.98.37.128, 194.230.55.99;
        #option vendor-string "TVSNNNNNNNNNNNjlhttps://webacs.iptv.ch/?config=32&mlpc=$PROVISIONING_CODE&mac=$MAC;http://webacs.iptv.ch/?config=30&mac=$MAC";
        option vendor-string nn:nn:nn:nn:....;
}

Once you get the TV box set up, here are a couple of rules that you'll need to 
add on your external-facing interface on eth0.10:

iptables -A INPUT -i eth0.10 -p udp -s 194.230.109.1 --sport 1234 --dport 1234 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0.10 -p igmp -s 1.1.1.1 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0.10 -p udp -s 194.230.109.1 --sport 1234 --dport 1234 -j ACCEPT
# Assumes that your TV box is 10.0.0.100.
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0.10 -p udp --sport 10000 -d 10.0.0.100 -j ACCEPT

You will need to run igmpproxy. Here's my igmpproxy.conf file:

### igmpproxy.conf start
quickleave
phyint eth0.10 upstream  ratelimit 0  threshold 1
        altnet 194.230.109.0/24

phyint eth1 downstream  ratelimit 0  threshold 1
### disable interfaces that you aren't using
phyint eth0 disabled
phyint eth2 disabled
phyint eth3 disabled
### igmpproxy.conf end

At this point your Sunrise TV box ought to be able to boot up and to watch live TV.

Watching recorded TV or pausing live TV and then pressing play later (which
essentially means that you still go from live TV to recorded TV) means that
you'll need some extra magic. You will need to have a little something that
I whipped up, that munges RTSP headers on their way through.

First you'll need to encourage RTSP traffic to be redirected to a local port on its
way through:

iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 554 ! -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j REDIRECT --to-port 554

Then you'll need to run rtsp.py in this directory. What this does is to it
intercepts traffic from the TV box and strips out the IP address to which
Sunrise thinks it needs to send RTSP traffic to your external IP address.
Otherwise Sunrise would be told to send traffic to your RFC1918 network's
address which clearly isn't going to work.

It also adds PREROUTING rules on the fly so that when your external interface
gets RTSP traffic that it knows where to send it to (i.e. to your Sunrise TV
box). And once you are no longer watching recorded TV, those rules get removed.
